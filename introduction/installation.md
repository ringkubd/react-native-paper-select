# Installation

This library depends on [react-native-paper](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/getting-started), [react-native-vector-icons](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons) and [@shopify/flash-list](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@shopify/flash-list). If you use [React Native Paper](https://reactnativepaper.com/) you probably already have it in your dependencies, so you're good to go. If not, please follow the instructions [here](https://callstack.github.io/react-native-paper/docs/guides/getting-started) to install it. Then run:

```bash
yarn add react-native-paper-select
```

or

```bash
npm install react-native-paper-select
```
Note: `@shopify/flash-list` is being used from `v1.3.0` in `react-native-paper-select`
